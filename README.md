## Contributors

There was a great deal of research done to complete this project. Part of that research was reading through the documentation for Sequelize and Dotenv. I also read through materials and articles from StackOverflow, and class resources provided by the boot camp and my student success coach, Lisa. I also received assistance from my TA instructors during office hours. In addition, I conferred with my classmates and colleagues.
